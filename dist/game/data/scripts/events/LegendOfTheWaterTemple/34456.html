Have you heard about the Mother Tree? We've learned that the Mother Tree's waning forces can be recovered with the Wondrous Water of Life.<br>
Also, we are studying the <font color="LEVEL">monsters that invaded the Water Temple</font> to get the Water Spirit power. However, to go there, there must be <font color="LEVEL">at least 2 adventurers in your party</font>.<br>
Don't forget to free up some space in your inventory before entering the Water Temple!<br>
