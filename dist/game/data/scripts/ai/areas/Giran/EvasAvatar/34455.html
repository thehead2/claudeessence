Greetings, adventurer!<br>
This is the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree</font>. It can restore the energy of earth. It plays a huge role in preserving balance in the world.<br>
The energy that nourishes the Mother Tree is at its lowest now, so it need the <font color="1051D3">Energy of Water</font>.<br>
If you have the <font color="LEVEL">Wondrous Water of Life</font>, you can use its Energy of Water to nourish the Mother Tree. You can obtain the Wondrous Water of Life for completing the <font color="LEVEL">'Assault on Water Temple'</font> mission.<br>
If you bring the Water of Life, the Mother Tree will grant you a buff from the Energy of Water.<br>
