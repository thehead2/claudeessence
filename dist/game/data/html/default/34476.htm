<html><body>Wasteland's Researcher Ken:<br>
Hello! My name is Ken.<br>
Have you heard that the deserted Wasteland became inhabited by some scoundrels? They occupied the oasis where Water of Life can be found and turned it into their camp!<br>
I also know that <font color="LEVEL">lots of spellbound monsters</font> have gathered <font color="LEVEL">near the Oasis</font>. If you defeat them <font color="LEVEL">Oasis Plunderer Vander</font> will appear.<br>
I'm trying to learn about the Oasis Plunderer as much as possible. If I have any new information I'll certainly tell you.
